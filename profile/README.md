## Introduction üëã

Launched in 2018 as a part of The 4thPillar project, the FOUR tokens acted as a crucial technical component in solving ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù communication settlement on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Due to its unique smart contract implementation, the FOUR tokens solve;

- an ERC-20 interface that can be used with any Ethereum native blockchain wallet, furthermore the ERC-20 standard allows FOUR to integrate with most EVM compatible Layer1/2's or Side Chains enabling various dApp RTA (i.e. right-to-access) models; 
- embedded TTS interface (i.e. token teleportation service), that enables wallet accounts to use ERC-20 FOUR natively as a GAS on EVM compatible Layer1/2's or Side Chains; 
- MTO (i.e. multiple-transfer option), a settlement service that conserves blockchain network transactions and bundles signed multiple transactions together, and settles them on the blockchain as one transaction.
