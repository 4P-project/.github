## Introduction 👋

On a mission to create robust dMail (i.e. decentralized email) and dChat (i.e. decentralized messaging) applications powered by community collaboration.

## Project Design 🎨

The project's design centers around community collaboration to which any community member can contribute. Decentralized email and messaging MVPs (i.e. minimum viable product) will be deployed, and available for community upgrades and development. Open-source GitHub repositories stand ready for anyone to fork and propose enhanced functionalities. A set of smart contracts is set to enable FOUR token RTA (i.e. right-to-access) models.

## Architecture by Layers ⚙

Zooming out, the architecture is quite straightforward. The Community-built dMail & dChat clients are on top, powered by the 4thTech SDK, OCC Protocol v.1, Encryption, Storage, and blockchain networks. 4P smart contracts enable FOUR tokens RTA (i.e. right-to-access) and Governance models within the system.
